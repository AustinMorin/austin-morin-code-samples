\subsection{Key Milestones}
% Milestones are points in the development where you have implemented some
% number of major features.  For senior project, you generally have five
% milestones: one at the end of 491, three in 492, and one in 493.
% In this section, divide the Major Features between the milestones.  You should
% front-load the schedule as much as possible.  That is, leave 10% of the work
% for the last milestone.  

Milestone 1: Alpha Version – sticks together edited videos
Milestone 2: Beta Version – Accepts CSV files and parses to URL
Milestone 3: Modified Beta Version – Accepts unedited videos, adds transitions, encrypts the URLs
Milestone 4: Testing/Debugging/Finalizing Documentation
Milestone 5: Final Release/Demo/Presentations

\subsection{Resource Assignments}
% Resources include budgets, consumables like paint, and computing equipment
% like servers and development systems.  Assign these resources, if any, to the
% tasks, listed above. 

Milestone 1+:
GitLab repo
Python (with video stitching library)

Milestones 2+:
Storage space (Jagodzinski's directory)
Camera equipment rented from WWU AV
Recording space, likely rented from WWU library


\subsection{Individual Responsibilities}
% Who is responsible for which parts of the development effort.

All of us will be working together on this project, since the work can't be easily split up evenly.
Some features may be developed simultaneously with other features, and who works on them will be
decided based on whoever is available to work on it.
