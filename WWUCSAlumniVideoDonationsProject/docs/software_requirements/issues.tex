\section{Issue List}
% Any outstanding requirement issues.  This is not your bug list, but rather a
% list of problems with the analytically step.  Consider the following example:
% Item 3.1, identification of uninitialized variables, is undecidable.  That is,
% it implies a solution to the halting problem.  A satisfying approximation is
% currently undefined.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When splitting our recorded videos into snippets, it relies on audio 
    detection to make sure a student or staff member is saying the anticipated 
    word. It is known that AI has a diversity problem and is not tested on many 
    non-English accents. Therefore, we are anticipating having many videos sent 
    to pending to be viewed manually due to the program being unable to detect a 
    word based on an accent.
    \item There is going to have to be someone to look through the pending videos 
    and name them manually. We anticipate our client as the department chair will 
    not want to do this himself. Finding someone with the time and patience to go 
    through them will be something we will have to address.
    \item The possibility of race conditions will need to be handled appropriately
    to avoid the loss of audio and/or video data. This could occur if two near identical
    audio, video files, or input CSV files are attempted to be processed at the EXACT same time.
\end{enumerate}
