\section{External Interface Requirements}
% List all external systems to which this project will interface.  For example,
% consider a traffic signal control system.  The red-yellow-green and cross-walk
% buttons are a required interface.  The system communicates over an RS-434
% hardware serial link.  

\subsection{User Interfaces}
1) Users will be required to operate a video playback system of their choice that supports .mp4 files, and know how
to access their URL video link using an email inbox of their choice (Outlook, Windows Mail, etc.)\\
2) QR codes in the video will be Version 3 QR Codes.\\
3) Linux command line on a Computer Science Lab Computer is responsible for the executing the video stitching program.\\
4) Cue cards will be drawn to adhere to accommodate visually-impaired users.\\
5) Videos will be recorded in 720p resolution at the most, and should be scalable to fit the entirety of the user's screen.\\
6) Release waivers will have specific instructions for signing before recordings occur.\\
7) Videos will contain minimal non-verbal messages to accommodate visually-impaired users.\\
8) Program input CSV file contains first name, last name, and graduation year of each alumnus.\\
9) Program output CSV file contains first name, last name, graduation year, and the hashed URL to their personalized video.\\

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}

1) Users will be able to access the URL video links regardless of what PC they are on (assuming that they are using a modern one that
can support video playback).\\
2) The stitching program will be run on a Computer Science Department computer that supports execution of Linux commands.\\
3) Videos will be recorded using a Zoomvid-6 WWU/ATUS rental camera.\\
4) The development team will need a USB cable to upload videos from the Zoomvid-6 camera.\\
\
\subsection{Software Interfaces}

1) Users will be able to access the URL video links regardless of the operating system that they are on (assuming that they are using
a modern one that can support video playback).\\
2) The stitching program will be run on an operating system that supports the Linux command line.\\
3) The development team will edit code using any IDE that supports Python 3.0 or later.\\
4) Git will be used to adding, pushing, editing, deleting, and merging files.\\
5) Gitlab will be used to store the development documents, source code, and video tests. \\
6) Alumni messages and video URLs are accessible via Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, Gmail, Microsoft Mail, and any modern inbox software.\\
7) Microsoft Excel will be used to store the information from the CSV files.\\
8) The Python library moviepy version 1.0.3 is used for video editing.\\
9) The Python library pydub version 0.25.1 is used for audio editing.\\
10) All user info will be stored remotely both on the CS Dept. Linux Computer and on any cloud storage platform of the development team's choice on their
personal devices.\\
11) The version of Python that the stitching program is written in is 3.9.\\

\subsection{Communications Interfaces}

1) Users will be able to access their personalized video on any connection type via WiFi, USB, Ethernet, etc.\\
2) Users will be able to access their personalized video only under their WWU Computer Science alias (i.e. you must be a graduate or
faculty member of the Computer Science Department to receive the video.\\
3) In order to access Gitlab or Computer Science Lab machines remotely, the development team must use download and use 
WWU's Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client VPN.\\
4) Release waivers that alumni and faculty must sign before being recorded.\\
5) Users will have access to the URL video link in a message sent via email.\\
6) Dr. Filip Jagodzinski will have access to all alumni email information and CSV files that he will use to communicate with
the faculty responsible for sending out the messages. Means of communication include email and remote transfer of the CSV files 
between Jagodzinski and the responsible faculty.\\
7) The final version of the program will be executed on one Linux machine, so there will be no need for other computers to communicate
with each other while running the program concurrently.\\
8) All video URLs are hashed to ensure security.\\
9) The cost of data transfer will be kept to a minimum, working with non-HD videos to decrease storage space needed to transfer video
files from one location to another.\\
10) The amount of text in the alumni's emails will comprise of a short greeting, a URL to the final stitched video, and a link to the
Computer Science Department's official donation page.\\
