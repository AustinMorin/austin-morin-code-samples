\section{Features}
% This section contains a list of requirement statements.  This should be of the
% form "the system shall..."  and worded in a way that satisfaction of the
% requirement can be verified.  For example, the software shall authenticate
% users with at least two identification factors.  

The system shall take long, pre-recorded videos of alumni saying specific words and phrases, and cut it into smaller snippets of video containing just the words and phrases.
The system shall be able to combine snippets into longer videos, and have the longer videos be personalized for a specific alumni based on given paramaters (graduation year for example)
The system shall store newly created videos in a secure location that can still be accessed online, and then hash the url of that location to be sent to an alumni.

% [For Each Feature]
\subsection{Name of feature}
Video Splitting
\subsubsection{Description}
% Describe the feature and how it fits into the overall product.  
The program takes a video of someone saying some words or phrases as input, then splits it into smaller videos where the silence between words/phrases is removed.

\subsubsection{Priority}
% Describe the relative importance of this feature. 
This feature is important because it means videos can be recorded in bulk without the need to manually splice them up.

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
% What event will trigger the feature and how should the system respond.  This
% is probably an excerpt of a use case. 
A user will run the splitting script on the specified file(s), and give an output name/location.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
% Formally state the functional requirement.
% The low-level format command shall require authorization by two
% system-administrators before beginning the low-level format operation.
The user inputs a video or series of videos, waits until the program is finished running, then recieves many smaller videos that partially make up the initial input.



% [For Each Feature]
\subsection{Name of feature}
Video Stitching
\subsubsection{Description}
% Describe the feature and how it fits into the overall product.  
The program takes a series of videos and stitches them together to make a personalized video message.

\subsubsection{Priority}
% Describe the relative importance of this feature. 
This feature is essential because without it, there would be no videos to email to alumni.

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
% What event will trigger the feature and how should the system respond.  This
% is probably an excerpt of a use case. 
A user will run the stitching script with the required paramaters (or a csv file containing all the required information).

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
% Formally state the functional requirement.
% The low-level format command shall require authorization by two
% system-administrators before beginning the low-level format operation.
The user inputs the required paramaters or properly-formatted csv file, waits, then recieves their requested personalized video(s).



% [For Each Feature]
\subsection{Name of feature}
URL Hashing
\subsubsection{Description}
% Describe the feature and how it fits into the overall product.  
The program takes a URL of a specified video and hashes part of it, ensuring that the link still goes to the original video.

\subsubsection{Priority}
% Describe the relative importance of this feature. 
This feature is somewhat important, because it wouldn't be good if alumni were able to easily access each others' videos.

\subsubsection{Stimulus and Response}
% What event will trigger the feature and how should the system respond.  This
% is probably an excerpt of a use case. 
Upon a stitched video being stored to its secure location, the program will then run the hashing script on that location's URL.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
% Formally state the functional requirement.
% The low-level format command shall require authorization by two
% system-administrators before beginning the low-level format operation.
The user runs the stitching script, and recieves the hashed URL of the stitched video.
